# Uncovering-hidden-AGN

This code forms the basis for the research conducted in the paper 'GZ JWST: Uncovering a Hidden Population of Obscured AGN between 2 > z > 4.'.

Using a deep learning image classifier on JWST NIRCam sources, we unearth a new population of highly obscured and compton-thick AGN candidates. We also make synthetic AGN sources using WebbPSF, and we use them to quantify our selection function.
